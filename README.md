## Freeze/Thaw scripts.  Or, poor-man's DeepFreeze

A long time ago I was working with a Windows machine that had DeepFreeze installed.  Deep Freeze will take a snapshot of
system upon demand and can revert to that snapshot after every boot.  We used it in an assisted-living library to
prevent the residents from over-riding system settings, changing the language, setting the wallpaper to porn or deleting
the C:/Windows directory (all of which happened at one point or another)

There are certainly more robust or professional solutions but this was quick, easy to understand and effective.

I then converted these machines to Linux (since the browser was the application used 98% of the time) and I wanted to
emulate Deep Freeze.  I stumbled across these scripts, tweaked them and held onto them since they worked so well.
